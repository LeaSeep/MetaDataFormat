## Notes

pre commit hooks enabled on Mac to put now VBA files under Verions control
check out the \*.vba Folders within the current_major

to checkout the hooks see .git/hooks/pre-commit.py and .git/hooks/pre-commit

If one changes files in Visual Code Studio, the files need to be manually imported to Excel.
For this add:
Attribute VB_Name = "MayFancyName"
For nicer structure within the vba project
